# Contributing to Social RSS

You can contribute with Social RSS by sending pull requests directly or creating issues on the corresponding repositories in case you need help or feel like you need to discuss something.  
Crazy ideas are welcome, so do not be afraid of looking stupid.  
Also, if something is not clear, it is probably my fault, so do not refrain from making questions.

There are no strong guidelines yet, but consider the following practices:
* [Pull request first](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6) - _TL;DR_ - Create a pull request as soon as you have your fist commit, document briefly in the PR's description what you intend to do, so that you can have feedback as early as possible. Use [task lists](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists) to keep your work in progress transparent.
* [Let the branch name do all the talking](https://codeburst.io/let-the-branch-name-do-all-the-talking-in-git-e614ff85aa30)
